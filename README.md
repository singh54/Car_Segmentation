# Project Name
> To segment cars into various categories by fuel consumption and other attributes.
> To classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

## Project Objective
-  To understand K-means Clustering by applying on the Car Dataset to segment the cars into various categories.
-  Apply dimensionality reduction technique â€“ PCA and train a model and compare relative results.


## Conclusions
- Number of features in the dataset are high and need is to reduce number of dimensions.
- Multicollinearity exixst between the existing features in the Dataset.


## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplolib
- Unsupervised
- Scipy
- Sklearn
